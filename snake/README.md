# Snake
This is a learning project with OpenGL.
It is not well written or documented.
I struggle with OpenGL for a long time.
This project is a rough example (maybe a bit fun).
No clean code or good architecture :-)

## snake.cc
- First working game with a 10x10 field
- Loads/Uses images as textures
- No directional textures/animations
- First 'tileset' fragment shader with a texture transformation (does not use it at all)

Target: just make it run and a tiny little bit of fun.
